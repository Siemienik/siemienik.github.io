# Open Source Projects:

Hello! I'm incredibly fortunate that many of you can benefit from the results of my work. Currently, these are mainly
projects related to processing Excel files. However, as soon as time permits, I have a bunch of ideas on how to improve
these projects, as well as start new ones in the future - I happen to enjoy experimenting. It will be interesting to see
what comes out of this!

For now, these are the projects and links to my documentation. Enjoy!:

* [ExcelJS](./exceljs/001-exceljs-homepage.md) - XLSX files workbook manager.
* [XLSX-Renderer](./xlsx-renderer/010-xlsx-renderer-homepage.md) - Generating excel files from templates.
* [XLSX-Import](./xlsx-import/001-xlsx-import-homepage.md) - Importing data from files into a typed data structure.

## How can you support me?

### Contributing

Do you like my projects? Add something from yourself, and they will also become yours. I firmly believe that there's
immense potential in the OSS community, which is why I strongly encourage engagement in open-source projects. If you use
ExcelJS or any of my other projects, I especially encourage collaboration - this way, you can develop the library in a
way that suits you, gaining support and gratitude from me and not just me, but the entire community ;D I have been
contributing to Open Source projects on GH for many years, and it really adds a tremendous amount of satisfaction and
prestige in every recruitment conversation.

### Sponsoring

Every time I talk about it, I feel a bit odd, like I'm begging. So I'll just mention this option
shyly: https://github.com/sponsors/siemienik

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank everyone who makes these projects possible, the entire community, and especially contributors,
sponsors, and clients!
